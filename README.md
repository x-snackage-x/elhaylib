# A personal C Library of useful data structures

The goal is to implement dynamic structures that can hold a defined `struct` and offer all the expected functionality. 

Structures to be implemented:

## Concrete Data Structures
- ~~Dynamic Arrays~~ Done
- Linked Lists
    - ~~Single~~ Cancelled
    - Double
    - Circular

## Abstract Data Structures
- Stack
- Queue 
    - Priority queue
- Tree
    - Binary
    - Avl
- Graph
    - directed 
    - undirected
    - weighted
- Hash-Map/Table
